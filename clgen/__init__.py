"""CLgen is a Deep learning program generator.

CLgen is an open source application for generating runnable programs using
deep learning. CLgen learns to program using neural networks which model the
semantics and usage from large volumes of program fragments, generating
executable programs that are representative of, but distinct from,
the programs it learns from.
